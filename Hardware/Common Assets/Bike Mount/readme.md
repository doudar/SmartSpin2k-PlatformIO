This directory contains the specific part you'll nee to connect SmartSpin2k to the head tube on your bike. 

If you cannot find one that exactly matches your bike, we've designed a mount in Openscad that you may be able to customize in Thingiverse to make your own.

If using the OpenSCAD or Thingiverse Customizer model.  Set the YokeWidth value as needed.  There may be rare occasions where YokeLength needs to be adjusted to suit a bike's geometry.
